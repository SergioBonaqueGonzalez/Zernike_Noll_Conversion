It performs the conversion between ANSI (OSA standard notation) and Noll notation.
When run, you can obtain the entire transformations vectors, stored in equivalent_OSA_in_Noll & equivalent_Noll_in_OSA arrays. You can also obtain the position of a certain zernike from OSA in Noll (and vicerversa), using ANSItoNOLL & NOLLtoANSI functions.
